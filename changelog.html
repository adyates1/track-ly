                A feature that's been in the works for a while now has finally been implemented, you can now delete

                Exams are over and we can now get back to working on Track-ly. We've implemented changes such as a
                character cap on names (after some very comical examples were sent to us). We also implemented some data
                sanitation for song queries. Also fixed some data issues, whereby lots of extraneous information was
                getting passed back to the user when they search for songs.

                After fixing up a few bugs we decided to release a beta version of our web app! It's gone down well so
                far, however there are a lot of apparent bugs. We've also had a lot of suggestions for new features and

                Over the past few days we've fixed a lot of small bugs, as well generated refresh tokens; which means
                that if the Track-ly's connection to your Spotify account is ever lost, then a new token is seamlessly
                generated without any supplementary user interaction.

                The user interface was changed from a white theme to a much darker one using the bootstrap secondary
                colours, which makes Track-ly much easier on your eyes. Potentially in the future we may allow

                We got the requests to the API to now allow for searching for albums and artists as well as tracks.
                These required multiple calls to the API, one to get the ID for the artist or album in question and the

                Bhav and I spent several hours getting the song searcher to work. Unlike what most (now outdated)
                documentation online says - the Spotify API now requires you to have a client ID and secret to
                even ask the API to return songs, this proved challenging as the AJAX request needed to be exceedingly
                specific just to get a list of songs, we were able to persevere and ended up getting it finished by
                around 1am.

                The basic networking of the application was built on the first night, I (Alex) handled things such as
                creating new rooms, joining rooms and handling users disconnecting from rooms.

            <h3>Initial Idea</h3>
            <h4>Date: 25/4/2018, Version: 0.0.0</h4>
            <p>I (Alex) initially came up with the idea of an app which allows users to create playlist for parties and
                events and allow everyone at the events to automatically update to the playlist. I knew Spotify allowed
                users to create playlists and for people to update them. The issue however, is that you have to be
                either
                friends with them on Facebook/Spotify, find their playlist, and then they need to give you write access
                to the playlist (and so on and so forth for everyone else at the party). The basis of this app
                would be to remove these strenuous prerequisites and let users to get back to easily adding songs
                to the playlist and have them automatically added to any guest's playlists. I told this to Bhav at a bar
                and he seemed on board.
