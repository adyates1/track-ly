        <div class="container border rounded border rounded-secondary mb-3">
            <p>Our web application (Track-ly) allows users to enter into private groups (parties) where they can
                collaborate on a playlist in real time. Collaborators can input songs that they would like to be played,
                via a text input box (they can search by referring to the actual track name, artist name or album
                name). Their search gets sent back to our server, which in turn sends a request to the Spotify API,
                querying the search data provided against Spotify's library. The results that get returned from the
                query by the API are then sent back to the user in the form of a list of songs. Then the user specifies
                which of those songs they originally meant. Once specified, this information gets propagated to all
                clients in the room and displayed to all of them. In this fashion, all clients in a room have the shared
                ability to add songs to the group playlist on the web app.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also make use of another Spotify API that allows users to link their account with Track-ly; and once
                they have done so, all songs that are in the groups playlist will be added to a playlist on their own
                account. Any more songs that get added to the playlist from anyone in the group will subsequently be
                added to the Spotify playlists of linked users. Any number of clients in the group can link their
                Spotify accounts to Track-ly and have their playlist update in real-time when songs are added to it.
                If clients don't want to create a new playlist from scratch, they can instead link any existing playlist
                that they have access to modify. Similarly to before, any songs that are added to the playlist from then
                on are also added to that playlist on their Spotify account.
            </p>

            <p>
                Those who create the party have the ability to set certain rules for the playlist, such as
                whether or not they want explicit songs on the playlist. (These explicit songs are determined by what
                Spotify deems explicit and Track-ly has not changed or altered any of this information). The host can
                also
                specify the maximum number of songs each individual user can add to the playlist. A third feature the
                host can
                change is whether or not they want guests to have the option of deleting songs from the playlist. If so,
                each
                song appears with a delete button (A red button with a white cross in it). If clicked, the respective
                song is deleted from each users playlist as well as being removed from their linked playlist on Spotify.
            </p>
            <p>
                Track-ly doesn't store information about users. Information such as what songs are in the current
                playlist are stored locally on each clients devices. Our service only facilitates the connection between
                each user and the Spotify API. The app does require the use of 'local storage' on the device for the
                application to work.
